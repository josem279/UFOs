# UFOs

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project was to create a webpage with a dynamic table that allows users to filter through the UFO sightings data based on multiple criteria. Initially, the table was only able to filter data based on the date. However, as a part of the challenge for this project, the table was updated so that it could be filtered based on one or more of the following filters: city, state, country, and UFO shape.

## Results

To better understand how the updated webpage works, below are few examples on the responsiveness of the table to our new filters:

Upon loading the webpage, the user will be presented with a non-filtered version of the table displaying all UFO sightings based on our "data.js" file:

To filter the data in our table based on one input we would simply choose one input and type in the input box:

If our initial filter does not filter out enough rows from our table, we can apply another filter to further narrow our search. Again, this is done by entering valid text into the desired input box:

Assuming that we have entered sufficient info into our input boxes and have found the UFO sighting that we wanted, we can restart the process by either clearing the text in our input boxes or by clicking the link to the webpage at the top left. Both options result in an unfiltered data table:

## Summary

One potential drawback of this new design is that the webpage is that a misspelled word in any of the inputs results in an empty filtered table as it searches for the exact text that is entered into our inputs.

In order to improve upon the design of this webpage, I recommend making the following updates:
